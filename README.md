# Fake-News-Detection
Fake news has turned out to be a menace. Distinguishing Fake news is a critical advance towards safeguarding the uprightness and prosperity of the society. With the increasing popularity of social media, thereâ€™s an upsurge in the propagation of counterfeiting news. There is a lack of proper frameworks for dealing with fake news. The following repository is an attempt to use benchmark datasets for analysis of fake news using machine learning approaches.

I have compiled a set of various datasets which can be used for analysis https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ipq6IbtQ5yQijzklNjqxlNEqNfEzsoz_

# Code Description

1. learning-rates.py: Compares the learning rates of different algorithms
2. comparision.py: Comparison of Accuracy Rates of different algorithms
3. Predicting-News-Class.py: Using our own search tokens for predicting the class, this will work only for news samples with same context to the data available in the datasets.
4. Sample-Classifier.py: A python program for a sample machine learning classification problem of fake news with plotting of confusion matrix
